# Czech Market Needs Analysis 2026: Marketing Automation & AI

**Source**: Analysis of job offers (Jobs.cz, StartupJobs.cz, LinkedIn) and industry trends.

## 1. Core Demand: "Strategic Orchestration"

Companies are no longer looking for just "execution" (running ads) but for **system orchestration**.

- **Job Title Trends**: "Marketing Automation Specialist", "AI Marketing Manager", "Growth Engineer", "Revenue Intelligence Architect".
- **Key Pain Point**: Fragmented data. Companies have HubSpot, Google Ads, E-shop data, and AI tools, but they don't talk to each other.
- **Goal**: Unified customer journeys and "Hyper-personalization".

## 2. Hard Skills & Tech Stack Demand (Verified from Job Offers)

What companies are actually buying (and thus what our platform must integrate with):

| Category           | High Demand Tools                                              | Implication for Platform                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Automation**     | **Make.com** (High demand), n8n, Python                        | Must have webhooks/API openness.              |
| **Data/Analytics** | **GA4**, BigQuery, Looker, Zoho Analytics                      | Needs robust data export/sync.                |
| **CRM/Email**      | **HubSpot** (Breeze AI), Salesforce, ActiveCampaign, Mailchimp | Native integrations are non-negotiable.       |
| **Generative AI**  | **ChatGPT/Gemini** (Content), Jasper, Copy.ai, Midjourney      | "Bring Your Own Key" or built-in generation.  |
| **SEO/Content**    | **SurferSEO**, Semrush, ContentShake                           | Integrated keywords/optimization suggestions. |
| **Social**         | **Sprout Social**, Brandwatch, OwlyGPT                         | Auto-scheduling and sentiment analysis.       |
| **E-commerce**     | **Shoptet** (Local king), Shopify                              | Specialized connectors for Shoptet are a USP. |

## 3. The "Missing Link" Roles & Skills

Job descriptions highlight gaps that our agency/platform can fill:

- **"Data Translator"**: Explaining AI insights to C-level.
- **"Prompt Engineer / Vibe Coder"**: Translating business goals into AI instructions.
- **"Process Architect"**: Mapping customer journeys before automation.
- **"Ethical AI Governance"**: Knowing GDPR/AI Act compliance.

## 4. Specific Czech Trends 2026

- **AI SEO (AEO)**: Optimization for AI search answers (Search Atlas/OTTO) is a growing niche.
- **E-shop Domination**: High demand from e-commerce players (Alza effect) for dynamic product feed optimization.
- **Adoption Gap**: 41% of large enterprises use AI, but SMEs are lagging due to skill gaps –> **Opportunity for easy-to-use tools**.

## 5. Strategic Recommendations for PRD

1.  **Python + Make.com Orchestrator**: Build a platform that manages _scripts_ and _scenarios_, not just a rigid tool.
2.  **Shoptet Connector**: Critical for local adoption.
3.  **"Executive AI Summary"**: Automated reporting that translates technical metrics into business ROI.
4.  **"Safe Mode"**: Built-in GDPR compliance checks for AI content (PII stripping).
