"### Overview" 
"The DevOps & AI Developer Portfolio follows a modern frontend architecture built on Astro 5.0 with island architecture, providing optimal performance through zero-JS by default while allowing selective interactivity where needed." 
"" 
"### Architecture Principles" 
"" 
"#### 1. Performance-First Design" 
"- **Astro Island Architecture**: Zero-JS by default with selective hydration" 
"- **Bundle Optimization**: Target <50KB gzipped JavaScript" 
"- **Image Optimization**: WebP/AVIF formats with lazy loading" 
"- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP <2.0s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1" 
"" 
"#### 2. Mobile-First Responsive Design" 
"- **Breakpoints**: 320px (mobile) → 768px (tablet) → 1024px (desktop) → 1280px (wide)" 
"- **Touch-Friendly**: 44x44px minimum touch targets" 
"- **Progressive Enhancement**: Base functionality on mobile, enhanced on larger screens" 
"" 
"#### 3. Accessibility-First Approach" 
"- **WCAG 2.2 AA**: Full compliance with accessibility guidelines" 
"- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and semantic elements" 
"- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete keyboard accessibility" 
"- **Screen Reader**: Full compatibility with assistive technologies" 
"" 
"#### 4. Privacy-Compliant Architecture" 
"- **Cookie-Free Analytics**: Plausible analytics without tracking cookies" 
"- **GDPR Compliance**: Full European data protection compliance" 
"- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only essential data for contact forms" 
"- **Transparent Processing**: Clear privacy policy and data handling"
