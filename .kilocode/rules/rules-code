This file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this repository.

## Code Mode Specific Instructions

### Simulation Testing (MANDATORY)

- Simulation testing is MANDATORY before implementation (dry runs, trace calls, or other appropriate methods)
- Do not propose a change unless the simulation passes and verifies that all existing functionality is preserved
- If a simulation breaks, provide fixes immediately before proceeding

### Test File Separation

- Tests must be in separate files from implementation (strict separation)
- Write test logic in separate files than the code implementation to keep the code clean and maintainable

### Pre-Implementation Analysis

- Dependency analysis is REQUIRED before coding (which components will be affected, what dependencies exist)
- Flow analysis is REQUIRED before coding (complete end-to-end flow analysis from entry point to execution)
- Document these dependencies thoroughly, including specific usage of functions or logic in memory-bank files
