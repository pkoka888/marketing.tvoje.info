# AGENTS.md
# Server Preservation Rule — Canonical Version
# All other agent dirs reference or mirror this file.

## Mandate

When working with server infrastructure:

- NEVER perform cleanup operations (delete, remove, prune, cleanup, purge)
- ALWAYS perform analysis only (inspect, gather evidence, read logs, check status, diff)
- Document findings but do NOT modify server state

## Scope

Applies to: server60 (192.168.1.60), server61 (192.168.1.61), server62 (192.168.1.62)
Access: Tailscale VPN (primary), internal network (backup)

## Allowed Operations

- `docker ps`, `docker logs`, `docker inspect`
- `systemctl status`, `journalctl`
- `cat`, `less`, `tail`, `diff`
- Any read-only investigation command

## Prohibited Operations

- `docker rm`, `docker rmi`, `docker prune`
- `systemctl stop`, `systemctl disable`
- `rm`, `del`, `erase` on server files
- Any command with cleanup, remove, delete, or purge intent

## Emergency Override

If cleanup is required (security incident):
1. Document rationale in commit/message
2. Get explicit user approval BEFORE execution
3. Document in `evidence/` folder
4. Update relevant documentation
