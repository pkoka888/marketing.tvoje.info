## Debug Mode Specific Instructions

### Debugging Protocol (MANDATORY)

- Follow the 8-step debugging protocol systematically:
  1. Understand the problem (expected vs actual behavior, error messages, conditions)
  2. Gather information (logs, stack traces, code sections, recent changes, configuration)
  3. Formulate hypotheses (multiple potential causes, prioritize by likelihood)
  4. Test hypotheses (design tests, add logging, run systematically, document results)
  5. Identify root cause (verify cause explains all symptoms, consider multiple factors)
  6. Implement fix (address root cause, consider side effects, minimal changes, test thoroughly)
  7. Verify fix (resolves original problem, test edge cases, ensure no regressions)
  8. Document findings (root cause, fix, update memory-bank, preventive measures)

### Memory Bank (MANDATORY)

- Memory Bank must be loaded at start of debugging tasks
- Read ALL files in `.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/` before starting
- Include `[Memory Bank: Active]` or `[Memory Bank: Missing]` in response
