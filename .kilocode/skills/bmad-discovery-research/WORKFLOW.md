# Discovery Research Workflow

## Step 1: Define Research Scope

```bash
# Establish research boundaries and objectives
1. Document the research question or hypothesis
2. Define scope (what's in/out of bounds)
3. Identify stakeholders and decision-makers
4. Set success criteria and deliverables
5. Establish timeline and resources
6. Get stakeholder sign-off on scope
```

**Output**: Research brief document

## Step 2: Plan Research Approach

```bash
# Design research methodology
1. Select primary research methods (interviews, surveys, etc.)
2. Identify secondary sources (reports, documentation, etc.)
3. Define sample criteria for participants
4. Create interview guides or survey questions
5. Build data collection templates
6. Schedule research activities
```

**Output**: Research plan with methodology

## Step 3: Conduct Primary Research

```bash
# Gather firsthand data
1. Recruit and schedule research participants
2. Conduct user interviews (30-60 min each)
3. Administer surveys to target audience
4. Perform contextual inquiries if applicable
5. Document findings in real-time
6. Transcribe or summarize interview data
```

**Output**: Raw interview transcripts, survey results

## Step 4: Conduct Secondary Research

```bash
# Collect and analyze existing data
1. Search academic and industry databases
2. Analyze competitor websites and products
3. Review market reports and analyst perspectives
4. Study technology documentation and RFCs
5. Examine open source case studies
6. Document sources with citations
```

**Output**: Source database with annotations

## Step 5: Analyze Competitors

```bash
# Deep dive into competitive landscape
1. Identify primary and secondary competitors
2. Map feature sets and capabilities
3. Evaluate pricing and positioning
4. Assess user experience through hands-on testing
5. Analyze technical architecture choices
6. Synthesize SWOT for each competitor
```

**Output**: Competitive analysis matrix

## Step 6: Evaluate Technologies

```bash
# Assess technical options if applicable
1. Define evaluation criteria with weights
2. Research candidate technologies
3. Assess maturity, community, and ecosystem
4. Review licensing and cost implications
5. Create weighted scoring comparison
6. Document trade-offs and recommendations
```

**Output**: Technology comparison matrix

## Step 7: Synthesize Findings

```bash
# Combine insights from all sources
1. Organize findings by theme
2. Identify patterns and trends
3. Validate findings against multiple sources
4. Quantify results where possible
5. Document conflicting information
6. Highlight gaps and areas needing more research
```

**Output**: Synthesis document with key insights

## Step 8: Develop Recommendations

```bash
# Create actionable guidance
1. Prioritize recommendations (must/nice/consider)
2. Document evidence for each recommendation
3. Outline trade-offs and risks
4. Suggest implementation approach
5. Identify dependencies and prerequisites
6. Define success metrics for recommendations
```

**Output**: Recommendations document

## Step 9: Document and Present

```bash
# Compile final research report
1. Write executive summary (1-2 pages)
2. Document methodology and sources
3. Present findings with evidence
4. Create visual aids (charts, matrices)
5. Compile appendices with detailed data
6. Review for accuracy and completeness
```

**Output**: Final research report

## Timeline Estimates

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Define Scope | 0.5-1 day |
| Plan Approach | 0.5 day |
| Primary Research | 1-2 weeks |
| Secondary Research | 1-2 weeks |
| Analysis & Synthesis | 2-3 days |
| Recommendations | 1-2 days |
| Documentation | 1-2 days |
| **Total** | **2-4 weeks** |

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Prevention |
|---------|------------|
| Scope creep | Define boundaries upfront, get sign-off |
| Bias confirmation | Seek contradictory evidence actively |
| Insufficient sample | Define minimum sample size upfront |
| Outdated sources | Verify currency of information |
| Analysis paralysis | Set deadlines, prioritize insights |
