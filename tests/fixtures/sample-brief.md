# Project Brief

This file serves as the foundation for the Memory Bank system. It defines the core requirements, goals, and scope of the project.

## Project Overview

This is a sample project for testing the Memory Bank validation system.

## Core Goals

1. Provide a standardized template structure for Kilo Code projects
2. Integrate prompt engineering capabilities through the Prompt Consultant mode
3. Include comprehensive documentation and configuration templates
4. Support memory bank integration for project continuity

## Project Scope

The template includes:
- Enhanced `.kilocode/` directory structure with modes, skills, workflows, and rules
- Memory bank system for project documentation
- Prompt consultant mode for prompt engineering tasks
- Configuration templates for environment setup
- Comprehensive documentation

## Key Features

- **Custom Modes**: Prompt Consultant mode for prompt engineering
- **Skills**: Prompt consultant skill with comprehensive guidelines
- **Workflows**: Pre-defined workflows for common prompt consulting tasks
- **Rules**: Integration with kilocode-rules for behavior control
- **Memory Bank**: System for maintaining project context across sessions

## Technology Stack

- Kilo Code AI assistant
- MCP servers for extended capabilities
- Markdown-based documentation
- YAML configuration files

## Development Notes

This template is designed to be copied and customized for new projects. The structure follows Kilo Code conventions and integrates with the agentic repositories for additional capabilities.
