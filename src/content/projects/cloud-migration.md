## Project Overview

A comprehensive cloud migration project that transformed a legacy on-premise infrastructure into a modern, scalable AWS-based solution. The project focused on improving reliability, reducing costs, and enabling faster feature delivery through infrastructure as code and containerization.

## Key Achievements

### Infrastructure Transformation
- Migrated from bare-metal servers to AWS cloud infrastructure
- Implemented Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Containerized all applications using Docker
- Deployed Kubernetes cluster for orchestration

### Cost Optimization
- Reduced monthly infrastructure costs by 40%
- Implemented auto-scaling to handle peak loads
- Utilized reserved instances for predictable workloads
- Optimized storage with lifecycle policies

### Reliability Improvements
- Achieved 99.9% uptime SLA
- Implemented multi-AZ deployment
- Created automated disaster recovery
- Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## Technical Stack

- **Cloud Provider**: AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, Route53, CloudFront)
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation
- **Containers**: Docker, Amazon EKS
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, ArgoCD
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch
- **Security**: AWS IAM, Vault, WAF

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning
- Analyzed existing infrastructure
- Created migration roadmap
- Designed target architecture
- Established security compliance requirements

### Phase 2: Foundation Setup
- Created AWS organization structure
- Implemented Terraform modules
- Set up networking (VPC, subnets, security groups)
- Configured CI/CD pipelines

### Phase 3: Application Migration
- Containerized legacy applications
- Deployed to Kubernetes
- Migrated databases to RDS
- Implemented blue-green deployment

### Phase 4: Optimization
- Fine-tuned auto-scaling policies
- Implemented cost optimization
- Enhanced monitoring dashboards
- Conducted disaster recovery testing

## Results

The migration project delivered significant improvements across all key metrics:

- **Cost Reduction**: 40% monthly savings
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime achieved
- **Deployment Speed**: 3x faster releases
- **Scalability**: Handles 10x peak loads
- **Security**: Full compliance achieved

## Client Testimonial
