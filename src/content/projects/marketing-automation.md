## The Challenge

A B2B SaaS company struggled with manual lead follow-ups and disconnected marketing tools. Sales team spent 80% of time on administrative tasks instead of closing deals.

2. **Klaviyo Integration**: Automated email sequences for lead nurturing.
3. **Workflow Automation**: Created triggered workflows for onboarding, re-engagement, and upsells.
4. **Lead Scoring**: Implemented behavioral scoring to prioritize hot leads.

## The Results

- **60% Improvement** in lead nurturing effectiveness.
- **80% Time Saved** for sales team on administrative tasks.
- **3x Increase** in email marketing ROI.
