## The Challenge

A Czech e-commerce company selling electronics was invisible on Seznam.cz and Google. Their outdated website had poor technical SEO, thin product descriptions, and zero content strategy. Competitors dominated the first page for high-intent keywords.

## Our Strategy

We executed a comprehensive SEO overhaul:

1. **Technical SEO Audit**: Fixed site speed, mobile issues, and crawl errors.
2. **Content Strategy**: Created product guides, category pages, and a blog with Czech-localized content.
3. **Link Building**: Built authoritative backlinks through PR and local partnerships.
4. **Analytics Setup**: Implemented GA4 with enhanced e-commerce tracking.

## The Results

- **200% Increase** in organic traffic within 12 months.
- **150% Revenue Growth** from organic search.
- **Top 3 Rankings** for 50+ high-volume Czech keywords.
- **85%** of traffic now comes from organic search.
