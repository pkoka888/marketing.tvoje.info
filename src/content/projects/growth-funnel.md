## The Challenge

A European B2B SaaS client was struggling with high Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) and stagnant lead quality. Manual campaign management was failing to scale across multiple markets.

## Our Strategy

We implemented a "Human-First, AI-Powered" growth engine:

1. **Behavioral CRM**: Transitioned to an automated Klaviyo/HubSpot setup that triggered personalized sequences based on intent.
2. **AI Bidding**: Leveraged autonomous bidding algorithms to optimize Meta and Google Ads spend in real-time.
3. **AEO Content**: Optimized the brand's knowledge base for AI Answer Engines (Perplexity/Gemini), capturing high-intent early-stage users.

## The Results

- **312% ROI** within the first 90 days.
- **45% Reduction** in CAC.
- **120%+ Increase** in qualified lead volume.
- **Top 1%** ranking for industry-specific AI queries.
