## The Challenge

A Prague-based fintech startup had an outdated brand that failed to resonate with their target audience. Their website converted poorly, and investor presentations lacked professional polish.

## Our Strategy

We delivered a complete brand transformation:

1. **Brand Discovery**: Conducted workshops to define brand values, voice, and positioning.
2. **Visual Identity**: Created a modern logo, color palette, and typography system.
3. **Figma Design**: Built comprehensive design system and high-fidelity prototypes.
4. **Website Redesign**: Developed a conversion-optimized website with clear CTAs.

## The Results

- **5x Increase** in brand awareness within 6 months.
- **40% Higher** website conversion rate.
- **100% Client Satisfaction** score on post-launch survey.
- Successfully raised Series A funding with new brand assets.
