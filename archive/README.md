# Archive - DevOps Materials

This folder contains archived materials from the previous DevOps/AI portfolio that was replaced with a Marketing-focused portfolio.

## Contents

Moved from project root:

- `ecosystem.config.js` - Was used for PM2 (not needed for static site)
- `backend/` - Was for a different backend project
- `bak/` - Old backups
- `.venv/` - Python virtual environment
- `devops-&-ai-portfolio.zip` - Old portfolio backup

## Kilo Code Skills Archived

The following skills were archived because they were DevOps-focused and not relevant to the marketing portfolio:

- `litellm-debug/` - LiteLLM debugging
- `server-monitor/` - Server monitoring
- `provider-fallback/` - LLM provider fallback
- `bmad-discovery-research/` - Old research
- `bmad-observability-readiness/` - Observability

## Why This Was Changed

1. This is now a **static Astro site** - no Node.js backend needed
2. Deployment is via simple file copy to Nginx, not PM2
3. Focus changed from DevOps/AI to **Marketing**
4. The project should be simple and maintainable
